# Pizza-form

**Pizza Shop 2.0 Form**

  - This is a simple web page that allows users to order pizza from a hypothetical pizza shop. It includes a form that asks for the user's name, pizza toppings, sauce, optional extras, and delivery instructions.

  - The form includes validation for all required fields, such as the name of the pizza, choice of toppings, and sauce selection. If any of the required fields are not filled out, the user will receive an error message prompting them to fill it in before submitting the form.

  - Optional extras are also included, such as extra cheese and a gluten-free base. The user can select one or both of these options.

  - The delivery instructions field allows the user to include any special instructions for the delivery driver, such as a preferred entrance or location.
